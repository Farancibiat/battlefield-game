## About the game
Battlefield it's the classic game where you can imagine a terrific naval war just seeing a simple table board.
To play this version of battlefield, you need to be focused on shooting at the hole navy of your enemy.
Playing it's simple, you just have to click on the board and check the color in the table of the site to see what it means. 

We challenge you to be as efficient as you can, try to do it on minimum shoots (16 shoots it's the mininum possible).
